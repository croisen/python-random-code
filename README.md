# Random Code (Python)
Random code for my own fun. Made when I started using python to code, and well I'm still using it
as there is some unfinished stuff in here.

## Installing dependencies
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/croisen/python-random-code.git"
cd python-random-code/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
And you can now run the python scripts with the python interpreter
